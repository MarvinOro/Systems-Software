In order to compile this program, first the hw4compiler.c attached must be
downloaded. Alongside with it the .txt files must be downloaded to the
same directory the parsercodegen.c was downloaded to.

The command "gcc -g hw4compiler.c" must be used to generate a program file
from the .c file. Now the program can be ran while passing the input file
from before by using the command: "./a.out [input file name].txt"
No user inputes will be necessary during the run time of this program.
A file named elf.txt should also be produced with vm.c input

The expected output will be shown directly on the terminal.
