In order to compile this program, first the lex.c attached must be
downloaded. Alongside with it a .txt file must be downloaded to the same
directory the vm.c was downloaded to.

The command "gcc -g lex.c" must be used to generate a program file from
the .c file. Now the program can be ran while passing the input file from
before by using the command: "./a.out [input file name].txt"
No user inputes will be necessary during the run time of this program.

The expected output will be shown directly on the terminal.
